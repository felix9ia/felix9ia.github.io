## Wireshark



### 解决思路

```
sudo chmod o+r /dev/bpf*
```



```
The capture session could not be initiated on interface 'en0' (You don't have permission to capture on that device).

Please check to make sure you have sufficient permissions.

If you installed Wireshark using the package from wireshark.org, close this dialog and click on the "installing ChmodBPF" link in "You can fix this by installing ChmodBPF." on the main screen, and then complete the installation procedure.
```
